# form-validator

Front end validation sign up form.

Before entering any data, input fields are red. Whenever it has missing input fields and click Register, it shows messages in the empty input fields accordingly.
After entering data into the input field and it matches the data format, it turns green.

At the bottom of the Sign up Form I created a button that warns us whenever the input is not correctly written or doesn't match the data format.

You can check the DOM to see it passes succesfully data into an object with the data you entered.
